# Starts a video stream from the Raspberry Pi camera using GStreamer and sends it to AWS Kinesis Video Streams
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy ~/.bashrc_exports.pi.example to ~/.bashrc and modify the variables as needed
#   2. Run the script:
#      ./stream_video_to_AWS.sh

# Check if AWS credentials are available
if [ -z "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" ] || [ -z "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" ]; then
	echo "Warning: AWS credentials may not be set. Make sure they are available in your environment or .env file."

# Notes on gst-launch options:
# -v : Verbose output, helpful for debugging.
# libcamerasrc: Source element for libcamera compatible cameras on RPi.
# video/x-raw...: Specify desired output format from the camera. Adjust width/height/framerate as needed.
# videoconvert: Handles color space conversion if needed (libcamerasrc might output something x264enc doesn't directly accept).
# x264enc: H.264 encoder.
#   - bitrate=1000: Target bitrate in kbps. Adjust based on network and desired quality.
#   - bframes=0 key-int-max=30: Common settings for low-latency streaming. key-int-max controls GOP size (e.g., 30 frames).
#   - tune=zerolatency speed-preset=ultrafast: Prioritize speed and low latency over quality/compression efficiency.
#   - byte-stream=true: Important for some streaming sinks.
# video/x-h264...: Specify caps for the encoded stream. profile=baseline is widely compatible. stream-format=avc and alignment=au are often required by KVS.
# h264parse: Parses the H.264 stream, makes it easier for downstream elements.
# kvssink: The AWS KVS sink plugin.
#   - storage-size=512: Optional: KVS producer SDK buffer size in MB. Default is 128. Increase if you see buffer-related warnings/errors.
